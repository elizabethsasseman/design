              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I initially thought it would be ideal to design a website that
                would walk clients step-by-step through the process of settling someone's estate after they've passed away.
                I thought the main goal should relate to the organization of documents online as opposed to on paper,
                and to allow clients to interact with attorneys virtually as opposed to in person.</p>
                <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">The last thing family members want to do after a loved one passes
                  away is go searching for lost documents while trying to determine what documents are actually needed
                  and who needs them. This seemed like a problem to me, and it seemed like a problem worth taking a closer
                  look at.</p>

              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I began asking friends and family for their thoughts on whether a
                step-by-step process seemed like something that would be helpful or not. It became clear that this sort of
                simplified process would be very helpful, but it was still very unclear the logistics of how a website product
                like this should actually function.</p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Through further brainstroming, I realized developing a legal document
                storage platform might be a good place to start at least at first. This would allow estate-planning attorneys
                and their clients to store and view documents virtually, thereby eliminating paper that could potentially
                get lost. But this type of product already exists so finding a way to incentivize a larger population of
                attorneys and their clients to store their documents virtually would be necessary.</p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I didn't want to build a product that would require me to hire
                attorneys or to be as knowledgeable as attorneys, I wanted to find a way to build a space somewhere
                between them. Below are some of the important questions I began to consider and discuss with people:</p>
              <ul class="alegreya300 mr-3 text-white ml-3">
                    <li>Who are my competitors? Storage software already exists, but how user friendly is it and what could make it better for clients and attorneys?</li>
                    <li>How could I talk to attorneys for research purposes without spending any of my own personal money?</li>
                    <li>Am I selling this to clients or law firms or both? Who will be paying us considering we have to make money somehow?</li>
                    <li>Other than attorneys, who else do clients go to when planning their estate?</li>
                    <li>What percent of clients are open to storing their estate plan in a cloud as opposed to at home?</li>
                    <li>Would it be possible to urge users to connect accounts like banking, social media and more in order to simplify the process of settling the person's estate once they've passed away?</li>
                    <li>Would it work to have users pay for this service after they've passed away?</li>
                    <li>Could I work out a deal with law firms where they give clients a discount in return for me promoting them within a directory on my platform?</li>
                    <li>What are my product's biggest selling points?</li>
                    <li>Will client's confidential information, such as bank accounts be stored on my platform or just linked?</li>
                    <li>How often do clients even use an attorney's services while planning their estate?</li>
                    <li>Are there any uncomfortable topics that might come up while settling a loved one's estate such as memberships or subscriptions to places the person might not want family to know about? Is there a way for my app to help eliminate this kind of conflict?</li>
                    <li>Is there any way I can offer my product to clients for free? And if so, indefinitely or just for awhile?</li>
                    <li>Is there a huge inconvenience that exists in estate-planning attorneys jobs that I could find a way for my platform to solve?</li>
                    <li>How should I market my platform? What kind of feel should it have, considering this is a very serious and sensitive subject?</li>
                    <li>Should my platform include a will-maker, preliminary questionnaire or other services for clients prior to meeting with their attorney?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Below are some of my sketches used to help me visualize better the
                    economics of how a storage platform business like this might work. The sketch on the right visually
                    describes my best idea out of the three. Law firms as well as financial advisors and possibly banks or
                    other businesses who provide estate-planning services, already have clients. So if I could find a way for
                    my platform to solve these businesses daily inconveniences, there might be a desire for them to bring their
                    clients to my platform. And eventually, clients may also find my platform on their own.</p>

              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I decided to meet with my friend, Josh who is a software engineer
                to discuss the constraints related to developing a website platform like this. Josh's biggest concern was
                security. A secure website would equate to client confidence in my product. A lack of security would be a
                huge problem.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Before doing any research, I reassessed where I was at in my design and
                realized I could structure my platform to include two types of participants who would exchange value in
                some way. With my current idea, I didn't
                have a clear idea of where value would exist in my platform. Restructuring it to allow for a value exchange
                between participants really helped create a clear idea of how value could potentially flow between users.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I also realized this platform could be marketable for more than just
                estate-planning. Although I might still initially market to only this niche, I wanted to keep in mind the
                entire market while researching.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">At this point, I wanted my research to help me find out what I could
                solve for law firms and what I could solve for clients. Ultimatey, if I could build one platform solving
                problems on both sides, I'd have a valuable and marketable product.

                in answering some important initial questions.
                I also needed to talk to people who fit the persona of prospective clients in order to determine what would
                make their lives easier when working with an attorney. I began by talking with friends and co-workers.

              <h2 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Analyze</h2>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">After talking with attorneys and receptionists at law firms in a bunch of
                different states, I became aware of a handful of inconveniences that exist in the daily job of attorneys.
                Although some inconveniences are very specific to certain disciplines or certain sizes of law firms, the
                general inconveniences shared between everyone is a lack of integration between software products used for
                daily tasks such as document storage, client intake, calendar, email and accounting. There isn't one affordable
                software product that integrates all of these daily tasks. Part of this has to do with how different the tasks
                are between firms and between sizes of firms. Salesforce, for example is closer to solving this integration
                problem but is very expensive and smaller firms can't afford it.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">After talking with people about what would make their lives easier when
                working with attorneys I found out people desire an easier-to-understand process in regards to estate-planning
                specifically as well as a cheaper process. Younger people felt the ability to connect with attorneys within an
                app would be great.

              <h2 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Brainstorm</h2>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Although I knew I would need to do more research, my current research
                had already helped me solve the chicken-or-egg-first problem that exists in starting a platform business.
                This problem tends to be difficult to solve. The chicken-or-egg-first problem for my platform idea exists
                because clients won't sign up to use my platform if there aren't any attorneys already available on my
                platform to provide services, and attorneys won't sign up if the demand from clients to use their services
                don't already exist on my platform.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I solved this by finding a way to provide an initial service to both
                sides which wouldn't have either side dependent on the other. This initial service would be free document
                storage. And I hoped to find a way to provide it within an environment that also helps solve some of the
                integration problems attorneys face. I would start by offering this free document storage to both attorneys
                and their clients. Once the platform of users on both sides grows, we'd implement our platform feature which
                would allow clients to search for and connect with attorneys. This would hopefully help retain these clients
                as future customers, inspire them to tell their friends and provide us with an actual source of income.
                Hopefully. Theoretically, we would make money because in return for free document storage, attorneys would
                be required to have clients pay via our platform. And clients would be charged a separate fee which would
                go to our business.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">With a clear picture of how my platform business would function, it
                was time to start thinking about how to design it. I created some storyboards to help me think through
                reasons users and attorneys would want to use our platform. You can check them out below:

              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">With these simple functions in mind, I began to create some quick sketched wireframes
                displaying the more marketable features of my app. You can see these below.
              </p>
              <h4 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Large Font Sizes</h4>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">With a large market existing in estate-planning, the interfaces needed
                to have large, easy-to-read fonts. The amount of verbal information on each page would also be kept to a
                minimum in order to minimize the amount of reading necessary.
              </p>
              <h4 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Easily Viewable Documents</h4>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">The ability to view and manage documents within a highly user-friendly
                environment would be extremely important considering free document storage is one of the platforms biggest
                selling points.
              </p>
              <h4 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Integration of Daily Tasks</h4>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">The app would eliminate the need for law firms to use more than one
                software product for daily tasks such as client intake, calendar, email accounting and document storage.
                Attorneys would be able to navigate between tasks without needing to "copy and paste" information from one
                software product to another.

              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">At this point, I needed to find a way to perform more intensive research,
                determine whether or not I'd be able to pull any APIs into my product, and
                decide whether or not I wanted to pursue starting a business or reach out to some incubators.
                If I wasn't going to be able to pull any APIs, I wouldn't want
                to build a product with these features from scratch. And if I couldn't solve the integration problem
                for law firms, I would need to determine whether document storage and an app to connect clients to
                attorneys would be enough.
                I also needed to consider whether the product would make enough money to cover the
                free document storage I'd be offering. I knew drafting up a business plan would be one
                of the next steps if I really wanted to get after this idea!
